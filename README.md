  - Example: `["Brand", "Generic"]` limits analysis to campaigns with *brand* or *generic* in their name.  
- **makeChanges**: Choose whether the script automatically applies negatives or just emails a review.  
- **emailAddresses**: List the emails to receive notifications.  
- **useWordInCommon**: Set to `true` to check if keywords and search queries share common words.  
- **useEditDistance**: Set to `true` and adjust **maxEditDistance** to define how many single-character changes make words distinct.
